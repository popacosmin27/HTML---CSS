# HTML & CSS Beginner Projects

This repository contains a collection of small **HTML** and **CSS** projects created while learning the basics of web development.  

⚠️ **Note:** Most of the projects here are unfinished or still work in progress.  
I keep them to track my progress and improve them later.
